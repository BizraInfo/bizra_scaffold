# BIZRA Lineage Seal Directory

This directory provides SDK-compatible access to lineage seal artifacts.

## Structure

```
lineage-seal/
├── README.md           # This file
├── MANIFEST.json       # Current pack manifest (symlink or copy)
├── SEAL_METADATA.json  # Current seal metadata
└── latest -> ../data/lineage_packs/BIZRA_LINEAGE_SEAL_PACK_<timestamp>/
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify the latest lineage seal pack
./scripts/verify_lineage_seal.sh --latest

# Or via Makefile
make verify-seal
```

## Generation

```bash
# Generate a new Genesis Seal
make seal

# Generate with OpenTimestamps anchor
make seal-ots

# Create a full Lineage Seal Pack
make seal-pack
```

## SDK Compatibility

This directory structure is compatible with the GENESIS_OS_AGENTIC_SDK v0.2.x
lineage seal specification. The verification script supports:

- **BLAKE3** hashing (preferred, with BLAKE2b fallback)
- **Ed25519** signatures
- **OpenTimestamps** Bitcoin-anchored proofs
- **Sigstore/cosign** keyless signatures

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `MANIFEST.json` | Content hashes for all pack items |
| `SEAL_METADATA.json` | Seal timestamp, algorithm, constitution hash |
| `TIMESTAMP.ots` | OpenTimestamps proof (if generated) |
| `*.cosign` | Sigstore signature bundles (if generated) |

## Court-Grade Evidence

For court-grade evidence, ensure:

1. ✅ OpenTimestamps proof is fully confirmed (1-6 hours after creation)
2. ✅ Sigstore signature is verified against OIDC identity
3. ✅ Constitution hash matches `constitution.toml`
4. ✅ All file hashes match manifest
