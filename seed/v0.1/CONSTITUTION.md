# BIZRA Constitution (Seed Draft)

This is the *operational* constitution: it links principles to enforcement.

## Layer 0 (Immutable invariants)

- **L0-01 Purpose:** Serve humans with excellence (Ihsan) as the ceiling.
- **L0-02 No Harm:** Reject actions that increase exploitation risk.
- **L0-03 Auditability:** Every state transition must be reconstructable.
- **L0-04 Consent:** Human-facing actions require explicit consent policy.
- **L0-05 Reversibility:** Prefer reversible actions; irreversible actions require stronger proof.

## Layer 1 (Enforcement mechanisms)

- FATE Gate: deterministic policy engine (pass / quarantine / deny).
- Ihsan Engine: scoring rubric over evidence.
- Ledger: append-only event log with hash chaining.

## Amendment process

- Amendments require: proposal → debate → tests → proof artifacts → signed approval.
